		<p class="about_para">Im a photographer that never knew such passions live within me.  When I was growing up I would tell people that I'll will be a doctor knowing that that's something i didn't want to do, but at the time I didn't know what was I wanted to do.  I've tried everything to real estate to sport but nothing stick on to me, until one day my told me to hold his camrea and take a picture of him.  He was so sure that I would mess up the picture, but it turn out that for a beginner I did pretty good.  It was him that told me that I should look into photograhy and I did.  Since than I've been shooting and every shot I taken has been special to be.  In a matter of no time I've found myself booked with gigg's and leaning how to deal with people.  I've live in New York Queen all my life and never explored New York so much due to photography.</p>
